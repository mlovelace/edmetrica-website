I am director of research for Gwinnett County Public Schools (GCPS), a district located in metro Atlanta and one of the largest school systems in the United States. I am an educational researcher with more than a decade of experience applying quantitative methods to large-scale research and evaluation projects in the field of K-12 public education. 

My primary research interest is in the development and application of early warning systems, essentially addressing the complex question: How do we best identify student risk accurately and early enough, with the least bias possible, and in a way this most useful for stakeholders? 

My training is in the more traditional aspects of research and statistical methods for education, but I am also deeply interested in data science. I am skilled in statistical programming (a devoted R/RStudio/tidyverse enthusiast, who also knows a little SQL and Python), project workflow, and a strong supporter of open science.
